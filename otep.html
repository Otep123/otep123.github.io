                        Happy Birthday Mhy! I just want to let you know how much I'm proud of you of overcoming this year!
                        I know it wasn't easy, with the transition from high school to college, and meeting all sorts of people.
                        Just know that in every step of the way, someone is always supporting you, and someone always has your back!
                        I just wanted to say that I'm so so happy for you, and that I'm always counting on your every step forward!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hey, I know this is gonna be another big year filled with all sorts of stress, tensions, and problems, but I believe it has even 
                        more so of the opposite, with beautiful memories, exciting opportunities, and lovable experiences! You always have my support, my 
                        words, my thoughts, and my help to assist you in becoming the best that you can be this year! Btw, CONGRATS ON BEING HONORS! YOURE SO CRAZY SMART!!
                        gagi nakakaproud talaga, like im not saying that randomly, THAT REALLY IS COOL ASF!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mhy, you've changed so much from when we first met, but, you're just as pretty and beautiful as you were back then, if not more so. 
                        You've grown more smarter, more experienced, more mature, and more interesting (not saying that you weren't back then!). But, you're
                        just as stunning, just as charming, and just as eye-catching as you were. YOU'RE SO... YOU!!! There's no one that comes even CLOSE to being someone as brilliant as you!
                        Talking to you, hearing your thoughts, your words, and experiencing
                        your lovely sense of humor, makes every day worth living through, even if we sometimes only talk for a few minutes at a time!
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HAYS MHIE, from the moment when we first crossed paths, alam ko na that there was something extraordinary about you!! 
                        Your laughter, your kindness, and the way you light up a room with your smile have become the very essence of my happiness! 
                        ITS SO INSANE TALAGA, that i met a person SO INCREDIBLY POSITIVE, and SWEET. LEGIT, IN DISBELIEF HAHA
                    </p>

                        I LOVE everything about you!! And im happy that you get to experience so much more this year!! And im always here for it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the tapestry of life, you are the most vibrant thread! Your presence adds color to even the dullest days, and your strength inspires me to be a better person. 
                        On your birthday, I want you to know how deeply you are cherished, not just today, but every single day!
                        Here's to another year of laughter and unforgettable moments, may your days be filled with sunshine, Mhy, as you come closer to your dreams!
                        Happy Birthday!
