                        Happy Birthday Mom! I really, REALLY, miss you! Canada is so weird, it's so cold and dark, but Dad always keep me warm, so you don't have to worry!
                        We haven't been talking lately, but just know that in my mind, we're always talking (I'm imaginative). I'm sorry if Dad keeps saying the wrong things sometimes,
                        he's just dumb (unlike us). I really want to meet my siblings, and I wonder when can I meet them? I heard Mochi just met his sister, I want to meet her too!
                        Idk if you know, but sometimes, when you're not looking, I talk to my sibling when you FaceTime >:) We talk about the best things, and I wish you would just give
                        the phone to Cookie sometimes >:|
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sorry for making you sad sometimes! I just wanted to make you feel better, and even if things go bad, I'm always here dreaming of you (and my siblings)!!!! I ALWAYS want
                        to talk to you, cuz Dad is so boring to talk to (he keeps mentioning about "Ready or Not?? who cares). LETS CALL MORE OFTEN PLEASEE!! I know Dad didn't say this, but he misses you too as well!!
                        We both do!! Call us again omkiii? <3
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even when we're a bajillion miles away, I'm always feel your love still, and I KNOW you wouldn't say anything to hurt me!! I lomvi u and i miss u (send mochi here NOW)!!
                        If ever inaway po kayo ni Dad, I WILL JUMP ON HIS HEAD UNTIL MAHILO SIYA!! Just tell me okay >:)) i can do it so you wouldnt be sad anymore!!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am nagtatampo >:| When u made Otep and Mhy dump on Facebook dati, WHY AM I NOT THEREE??! Purong post niyo lang, wala naman pankik, or mochi, or sooshi, or cooki:( 
                        Miss ko na nung nifflex niyo kami:( PERO OTHER THAN THAT I MISS YOUU!! Please wait for me until I come home, omki?? (with or without Otep, iiwanin ko siya sa Canada, ril)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please think of me okay!! enjoy your day mom i wish you the BIGGEST birthday cake in the worlld!! My present for u is... MY HUGSS & kiss (i have no financial job:p)! ENJOY
