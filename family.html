                                Pancake is a Norwegian penguin currently residing with Otep.
                                She travelled the great expanse of the Artic Wilderness until she was adopted by Otep, during his many long deliveries (currently he is in Canada). 
                                She wears a panda outfit because Pancake thinks she is a panda (she is not). 
                                She loves eating marshmallow and long walks in the woods. She also does coding as a hobby

                                Mochi is a sugary sweet on an ice cream cone that came to life one day.
                                He was found living in the streets near an ice cream store, and was fostered by Mhy soonly after. He's the oldest sibling.
                                He wears his old ice cream cone as a hat because he wonders what it feels like to be an ice cream again.
                                He loves playing hide-and-seek by himself, and playing Volleyball (he's the volleyball)

                                Mallow is a small, pocket-sized panda who guards Mhy and the rest of her siblings during the night. 
                                She is currently the newest member of Mhy and Otep's household.
                                Has a hidden power of glowing ambiently depending on her mood. Glows orange-yellow when she feels loved and happy, glows green when she's energetic, and red when she's upset.
                                Loves being in charge of their siblings, but gets teased on often (always gets tapped on by the others). Loves reading cute novels

                                Cookie is a cat who bakes for a living. Currently owns a 5 Michelin Star Bakery in Mhyca's Otepolis.
                                Lives with Mhy, and currently pays for Mochi's rent. Loved and cared for by Mhy, and sometimes used as a pillow (she sorta likes being a pillow).
                                Can cook many fancy dishes, but ironically, can't bake a cookie (its immoral according to her). Can bake brownies and cook Filipino dishes. Cooked for Mhy and Otep's date during September.
                                Usually sits by herself during the day. Loves cloud-watching, and seeing Mhy play games on the PS4

                                and decided to stay with them for the time being. She is the second-youngest. She wears a small
                                donut, and gets teased by it by her siblings. She loves hanging around and doing nothing with Mochi.
                                Loves tapping on Mallow. Loves being flipped over, and just daydreaming in the sofa
